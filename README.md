# Car Price Prediction

## Overview

Car Price Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the prices of cars based on a set of attributes and features. This project employs predictive modeling techniques to assist users in estimating the market value of a car. The core idea is to create a model that can predict car prices accurately by analyzing historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars and their corresponding prices. The dataset typically includes the following attributes:

- **Make**: The manufacturer or brand of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda).
- **Model**: The specific model of the car (e.g., Camry, Civic).
- **Year**: The year in which the car was manufactured.
- **Mileage**: The total distance the car has been driven.
- **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Gasoline, Diesel).
- **Transmission**: The type of transmission (e.g., Automatic, Manual).
- **Location**: The geographical location where the car is being sold.
- **Price**: The actual price of the car (the target variable we want to predict).

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- **data/**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks are provided for various stages of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **src/**: This directory holds the source code for the car price prediction model.
  - **data_preprocessing.py**: A Python script for data preprocessing, which handles tasks such as missing value imputation, categorical variable encoding, and numerical feature scaling.
  - **model_training.py**: A Python script for training the machine learning model. The trained model is saved in the `models/` directory.
  - **predict.py**: A Python script for making car price predictions using the trained model.
- **requirements.txt**: A text file listing the Python packages and dependencies required to run the code.
- **README.md**: The current README file providing an overview and instructions for the project.
